The objective of this project is to design and implement a basic Send-And-Wait protocol simulator. The protocol will be half-duplex and use sliding windows to send multiple packets between two hosts on a LAN with an \"unrealiable network\" between the two hosts. The following diagram depicts the model:\nYour Mission\n - You may use any language of your choice to implement the three components shown in the diagram above. It is strongly recommended that you use your code from the first assignment to implement the peer stations.\n - You will be designing an application layer protocol in this case on top of UDP (in keeping with the wireless channel model). The protocol should be able to handle network errors such as packet loss and duplicate packets. You will implement timeouts and ACKs to handle retransmissions due to lost packets (ARQ).
